# Nucleus 3.0 ALPHA 1

Nucleus 3 is a major rewrite of pretty much the entire plugin, to support SpongeAPI 8.0.

As it stands, Nucleus 3 is NOT stable. This release is a proof of concept and things are expected to be broken.

Changes and updates will be provided in future release notes, but most of what you know should still be there. Feel free to test this on testing platforms, do not use this on production systems yet.
