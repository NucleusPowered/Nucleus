# Nucleus 3.0 BETA

Nucleus 3 is a major rewrite of pretty much the entire plugin to support SpongeAPI 8.0.

As it stands, Nucleus 3 is NOT 100% stable. Please help testing, and please let us know of any bugs on Github issues!

No docs are available either, but most of v3 will operate on a user level the same as v2. Documentation will follow at a later stage.

**If you are upgrading from a previous version, data conversion is NOT GUARANTEED at this stage. Please make a backup BEFORE upgrading. AS ALWAYS, WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DATA LOSS.**

Changes and updates will be provided in future release notes, but most of what you know should still be there.
