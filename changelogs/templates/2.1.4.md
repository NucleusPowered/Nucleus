For the things YOU need to do as a server owner, [please visit our instructions on how to upgrade](https://v2.nucleuspowered.org/docs/howto/migrate.html).

# New Features

## Added "ultra-aggressive" pre-generation mode

`/world border gen` now has the `-u` flag in order to attempt to use as much time as possible pre-generating a world. 
Server owners should only use this mode on an empty server. This mode:

* Causes chunk generation to happen every tick.
* Tries to use at least 95% of each tick time generating.
* Saves world state every two minutes.

Using this mode may cause crashes and severe server lag, but may be useful for new servers who are not yet open to the public. 

# Bug Fixes

* Fix `/home other` not checking the correct user for exemption permissions.
* Fix `/enderchest` not using the player argument if supplied, always returning the invoker's enderchest.
